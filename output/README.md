# Output Files

This directory contains example output files generated by `bitcoin-keygen`.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT SECURITY WARNING

**The files in this directory are EXAMPLE files only.** They use well-known test vectors and should NEVER be used for actual Bitcoin storage. 

**DO NOT use these seed phrases for real wallets!**

## File Descriptions

### `seed_phrase_printable.txt`
The main printable file optimized for metal plate punching. Contains:
- All 24 seed words in multiple formats (4-column grid and single column)
- Security warnings and verification checklist
- Hardware wallet import instructions
- Master key fingerprint for verification

### `seed_words_simple.txt`
A simple numbered list of all 24 words, one per line. Easy to read and verify.

### `seed_words_for_coldcard.txt`

## Example Generation

To generate your own secure seed phrases (on an air-gapped computer):

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/bitcoin-keygen "Your Wallet Label"
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Always run on air-gapped computers** - Never generate seed phrases on internet-connected devices
2. **Print and verify** - Manually verify all words before punching metal plates
3. **Secure storage** - Store metal plates in fireproof, secure locations
4. **Multiple backups** - Create backup copies in separate geographic locations
5. **Test first** - Always test with small amounts before storing significant funds
6. **Clean up** - Delete all files after printing and verification

## Example Files

The example files in this directory use the BIP39 test vector:
- Mnemonic: `abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon about`
- This is a well-known test vector and should NEVER be used for real wallets

These files are provided for:
- Understanding the output format
- Testing the application
- Documentation purposes

**Again: DO NOT use these example seed phrases for actual Bitcoin storage!**
